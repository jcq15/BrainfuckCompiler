# What's Brainfuck

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck):

**Brainfuck** is an [esoteric programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language) created in 1993 by [Urban MÃ¼ller](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Urban_M%C3%BCller&action=edit&redlink=1), and notable for its extreme minimalism.

The language consists of only eight simple commands and an [instruction pointer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_pointer). While it is fully [Turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness), it is not intended for practical use, but to challenge and amuse [programmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmers). Brainfuck simply requires one to break commands into microscopic steps.

The language's name is a reference to the slang term *brainfuck*, which refers to things so complicated or unusual that they exceed the limits of one's understanding.
